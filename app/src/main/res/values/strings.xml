        <item>DraVA combines easy-to-use technology and smart data science to make it easier for people to become safer drivers.

        <item>This is a must have app for parents with teens who are just starting to drive.

        <item>DraVA is the perfect solution for parents/guardians who want to help their teens improve their driving skills.
            Parents/guardians can easily access the teen driver\'s performance with detailed bad driving behaviour information.
        </item>
        <item>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It
            was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
            publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum
        </item>
        <item>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
            The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using \'Content here,
            content here\', making it look like readable English.
